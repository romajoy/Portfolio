        <p id="bio-paragraph" class="bio-paragraph">
            Born and raised in metro Detroit, I am a proud Michigander and Red Wings fan. Having worn many hats over the years (Salon Manager in Ann Arbor, Exec Admin in Amsterdam, and Librarian in Chicago) I enjoy taking on challenges, bringing order out of chaos, and managing teams with transparency. 
            <br><br>Over my decade+ of management experience, I've developed a love for fostering a workplace that encourages belgonging and enablement.  As I transition into the becoming a full-stack software engineer, I hope to incorporate what I've learned through my non-tradidtional background into my future jobs.  <br> <br>
            In my free time I enjoy reading dystopian novels, fostering cats and dogs, knitting sweaters and defending my fourth place spot in my euchre league.<br> <br>
