Portfolio Project Repo

This is my Unit 1 Project: a Portfolio Website

This website contains four sections: About Me, Resume, Portfolio & a Footer.

# About Me

The About Me section expands when you click into the "About Me" header.  This contains a small bio and has a link to my email address.

# Resume 

The Resume section expands when you click into the "Resume" header.  This should also minimize the "About Me" and "Portfolio" sections at the same time.
This section has my Professional Experience, Skills, Educations and Volunteer experience listed.
As you click into each section, that section should expand while the details of the other sections disappear.  
The Professional Experience section begins with each of my previous job titles showing, and you can click on the job title to expand for a deeper description.

# Portfolio

The Portfolio section expands when you click into the "Portfolio" header.  This should also minimize the "About Me" and "Resume" sections at the same time.
This section has a space for me to post my future projects for General Assembly.  There will also be links to the GA github pages when these projects have been completed.

# Footer

The footer should remain showing at the bottom of the page, no matter what section you have open.
In my footer you will find an icon and link for my Instagram, LinkedIn and GitHub pages.
These links should open those pages in a new tab.

# Media
If you view these pages on a mobile device that displays less than 600px of width.
The padding on each section should expand and only show 5px of padding instead of the normal 60-80px that it has on a web browser.

I hope you enjoyed reviewing this project, and I look forward to your feedback!
