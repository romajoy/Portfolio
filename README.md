Portfolio Project Repo

This is my Unit 1 Project: a Portfolio Website

This website contains four sections: About Me, Resume, Portfolio & a Footer.  I used HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery to create this website.
You can find the website live here: https://joyful-paprenjak-540a3b.netlify.app/ 

I approached building this website first by writing out a sketch of what I wanted each section to look like, listing the elements included and functions needed.  Then, I pseudo coded in my files a rough outline of what I would need and what order I wanted things to be in.  I then went through and built out all my HTML elements, and started adding some CSS to give it form.  Next, I went to my JS elements, and created all some functions I knew I'd be using with jquery.  After this, I started to go back and forth between CSS and jquery to get things to look and perform the way I desired.  Once I had a pretty established project, I started to fine-tune things like the color palette and show/hide speeds, and I then started to fill out the different sections with actual content (instead of place-holder lorem).  I plan to update the "project" section as we continue and add more projects to our portfolio, so there is placeholder text for now.  I implimented hover elements on every section that can expand to let the user know that there is functionality there.  The website shoud open with all elements collapsed.

# About Me

The About Me section expands when you click into the "About Me" header.  This contains a small bio and has a link to my email address.

# Portfolio

The Portfolio section expands when you click into the "Portfolio" header.  This should also minimize the "About Me" and "Resume" sections at the same time.  This section uses a simple carousel to let you cycle through all my projects. I have included a simple budget app that I made during a beginning coding workshop, and I hope to add more projects from my time at GA.  Each project section will have a link to the project page on GitHub and a brief description.

# Resume 

The Resume section expands when you click into the "Resume" header.  This should also minimize the "About Me" and "Portfolio" sections at the same time.
This section has my Professional Experience, Skills, Educations and Volunteer experience listed.
As you click into each section, that section should expand while the details of the other sections disappear.  
The Professional Experience section begins with each of my previous job titles showing, and you can click on the job title to expand for a deeper description.

# Footer

The footer should remain showing at the bottom of the page, no matter what section you have open.
In my footer you will find an icon and link for my Instagram, LinkedIn and GitHub pages.
These links should open those pages in a new tab.

# Media
If you view these pages on a mobile device that displays less than 600px of width.
The padding on each section should expand and only show 5px of padding instead of the normal 60-80px that it has on a web browser, and the font on some of my smaller sections should become smaller as well.

I hope you enjoyed reviewing this project, and I look forward to your feedback!
